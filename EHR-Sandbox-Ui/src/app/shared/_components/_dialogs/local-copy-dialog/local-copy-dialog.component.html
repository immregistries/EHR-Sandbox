<h2>Copy patient to facility</h2>
<p>This functionality allows you to create a new entity, with the same information, in another facility. The main purpose is to experiment with IIS information merging and subscription workflows</p>
<p>Copying a vaccination will also copy the associated patient, several copies can be made without duplicating the patient</p>
